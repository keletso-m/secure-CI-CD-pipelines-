# Secure CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **secure Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** for a sample application.  
The goal is to showcase how DevSecOps practices can be integrated into the software lifecycle by adding automated **testing, security scanning, and deployment** steps.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **CI/CD with GitHub Actions**
  - Automated build and test pipeline.
- **Security Checks**
  - [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) for container and dependency vulnerability scanning.
  - [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) for open-source dependency security.
  - [OWASP ZAP](https://owasp.org/www-project-zap/) for basic web app scanning.
- **Containerization**
  - Application is packaged into a Docker image.
- **Deployment**
  - Docker image pushed to a container registry (e.g., DockerHub).
  - Optional: deploy to a test environment (e.g., AWS ECS, Kubernetes, or local Docker Compose).
